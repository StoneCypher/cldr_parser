The CLDR is the the [Unicode Common Locale Data Repository](http://cldr.unicode.org/).
It's a set of rules regarding localization: how to write numbers, times, dates, names,
calendar months, and so on.

Getting localization right is surprisingly complicated.  The CLDR is a data driven
attempt to document, in a machine parseable way, what all these various language and
country pairs actually expect.

Needless to say, it comes in its own unique several format set.  Nauseating.

HERE BE THY RING OF DECODERING, SWINE.
